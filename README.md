Some of my favourite and most referred to materials for backend

### Youtube Channels 
- [Hussein Nasser's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GISIGeometry) - short engaging videos on backend topics, organised by levels and upto date news 
- [System design Interview Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9vLsnF6QPYuH51njmIooCQ) - no new updates but some of the best videos on system design
- [Books on System Design  by sudoCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dqvbDModlw) - this in particular video I watched that completely validates my feeling that system design is not all individual experience and intuition. 

### Books
- [Clean Architecture by Robert Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=system+design&qid=1605312398&sr=8-6&linkCode=sl1&tag=365blottochal-20&linkId=3d8ff18842c09bca401aa061f9fd76ad&language=en_US) - currently reading, short chapter, simple language/reasoning and written from the prespective of someone who has seen SE mature.

### Github repos
- [Donne Martin design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) - my intro to system design, I like the format
